# Brain-Tumor-Detection-and-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
This project classifies brain MRI images into 4 categories using a VGG16-based deep learning model.

## Structure
- **Training** and **Testing** done using a custom data generator with OpenCV preprocessing.
- **Model**: VGG16 + Fully Connected Layers (Transfer Learning).
- **Prediction** on new images with saved `.keras` model.
