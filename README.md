# Brain-Tumor-Detection-and-Classification-using-Deep-Learning

This project aims to classify brain MRI images into four categories â€” **Glioma**, **Meningioma**, **Pituitary Tumor**, or **No Tumor** â€” using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and visualize tumor regions using OpenCV. The model is trained using TensorFlow/Keras and supports both prediction and visualization.

## ðŸ§ª Model Overview

- Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Input: MRI brain image (`224x224x3`)
- Output: One of four classes:
  - `glioma`
  - `meningioma`
  - `pituitary`
  - `no_tumor`
